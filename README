What is this?

Commits to AppNexus source code all happen against an RT.  Even
issues that don't address an RT directly use rt 0.  The convention
is to paste the subject of the rt ticket into the commit msg
so that the log is pretty and we can build release notes easily.

I got tired of pasting subjects in from the web browser all the time,
so I wrote this script instead.
